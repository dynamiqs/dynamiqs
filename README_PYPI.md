High-performance quantum systems simulation with JAX.

**Dynamiqs** is a Python library for **GPU-accelerated** and **differentiable** quantum simulations. Solvers are available for the Schrödinger equation, the Lindblad master equation, the stochastic master equation, and others. The library is built with [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and the main solvers are based on [Diffrax](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).

Documentation is available on our website, <https://www.dynamiqs.org>; see the [Python API](https://www.dynamiqs.org/stable/python_api/index.html) for a list of all implemented functions.

The main features of **Dynamiqs** are:

- Running simulations on **CPUs** and **GPUs** with high-performance.
- Executing many simulations **concurrently** by batching over Hamiltonians, initial states or jump operators.
- Computing **gradients** of arbitrary functions with respect to arbitrary parameters of the system.
- Full **compatibility** with the [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) ecosystem with a [QuTiP](https://qutip.org/)-like API.

We hope that this library will prove useful to the community for e.g. simulation of large quantum systems, gradient-based parameter estimation or quantum optimal control. The library is designed for large-scale problems, but also runs efficiently on CPUs for smaller problems.

⚠️ This library is under active development and some APIs and solvers are still finding their footing. While most of the library is stable, new releases might introduce breaking changes.

## Installation

You can install Dynamiqs with `pip`:

```shell
pip install dynamiqs
```

ℹ️ If you're using a GPU, please refer to the [JAX installation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) documentation page for detailed instructions on how to install JAX for your device.

## Examples

### Simulate a lossy quantum harmonic oscillator

This first example shows simulation of a lossy harmonic oscillator with Hamiltonian $H=\omega a^\dagger a$ and a single jump operator $L=\sqrt{\kappa} a$ from time $0$ to time $T$, starting from the initial coherent state $\ket{\alpha_0}$.

```python
import dynamiqs as dq
import jax.numpy as jnp

# parameters
n = 16          # Hilbert space dimension
omega = 1.0     # frequency
kappa = 0.1     # decay rate
alpha0 = 1.0    # initial coherent state amplitude
T = 2 * jnp.pi  # total evolution time (one full revolution)

# initialize operators, initial state and saving times
a = dq.destroy(n)
H = omega * dq.dag(a) @ a
jump_ops = [jnp.sqrt(kappa) * a]
psi0 = dq.coherent(n, alpha0)
tsave = jnp.linspace(0, T, 101)

# run simulation
result = dq.mesolve(H, jump_ops, psi0, tsave)
print(result)
```

```

### Compute gradients with respect to some parameters

Suppose that in the above example, we want to compute the gradient of the number of photons in the final state at time $T$, $\bar{n} = \mathrm{Tr}[a^\dagger a \rho(T)]$, with respect to the frequency $\omega$, the decay rate $\kappa$ and the initial coherent state amplitude $\alpha_0$.

```python
import dynamiqs as dq
import jax.numpy as jnp
import jax

# parameters
n = 16          # Hilbert space dimension
omega = 1.0     # frequency
kappa = 0.1     # decay rate
alpha0 = 1.0    # initial coherent state amplitude
T = 2 * jnp.pi  # total evolution time (one full revolution)

def population(omega, kappa, alpha0):
    """Return the oscillator population after time evolution."""
    # initialize operators, initial state and saving times
    a = dq.destroy(n)
    H = omega * dq.dag(a) @ a
    jump_ops = [jnp.sqrt(kappa) * a]
    psi0 = dq.coherent(n, alpha0)
    tsave = jnp.linspace(0, T, 101)

    # run simulation
    result = dq.mesolve(H, jump_ops, psi0, tsave)

    return dq.expect(dq.number(n), result.states[-1]).real

# compute gradient with respect to omega, kappa and alpha
grad_population = jax.grad(population, argnums=(0, 1, 2))
grads = grad_population(omega, kappa, alpha0)
print(f'Gradient w.r.t. omega : {grads[0]:.4f}')
print(f'Gradient w.r.t. kappa : {grads[1]:.4f}')
print(f'Gradient w.r.t. alpha0: {grads[2]:.4f}')
```

```text
|██████████| 100.0% ◆ elapsed 5.94ms ◆ remaining 0.00ms
Gradient w.r.t. omega : 0.0000
Gradient w.r.t. kappa : -3.3520
Gradient w.r.t. alpha0: 1.0670
```

ℹ️ On this specific example, we can verify the result analytically. The state remains a coherent state at all time with complex amplitude $\alpha(t) = \alpha_0 e^{-\kappa t/2} e^{-i\omega t}$, and the final photon number is thus $\bar{n} = |\alpha(T)|^2 = \alpha_0^2 e^{-\kappa T}$. We can then compute the gradient with respect to the three parameters $\theta = (\omega, \kappa, \alpha_0)$:

$$
\nabla_\theta\ \bar{n} = \begin{pmatrix}
  \partial\bar{n} / \partial\omega \\\\
  \partial\bar{n} / \partial\kappa \\\\
  \partial\bar{n} / \partial\alpha_0
\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}
  0 \\\\
  -\alpha_0^2 T e^{-\kappa T} \\\\
  2 \alpha_0 e^{-\kappa T}
\end{pmatrix}
\approx \begin{pmatrix}
  0.0 \\\\
  -3.3520 \\\\
  1.0670
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## More features!

Below are some cool features of **Dynamiqs** that are either already available or planned for the near future.

**Solvers**

- Choose between a variety of methods for each solver, from **modern** explicit and implicit ODE methods (e.g. Tsit5 and PID controllers for adaptive step-sizing) to **quantum-tailored** methods that preserve the physicality of the evolution (the state trace and positivity are preserved).
- Simulate **time-varying problems** (both Hamiltonian and jump operators) with support for various formats (piecewise constant operator, constant operator modulated by a time-dependent factor, etc.).
- Define a **custom save function** during the evolution (e.g. to register only the state purity, to track a subsystem by taking the partial trace of the full system, or to compute the population in the last Fock states to regularise your QOC problem).
- Easily implement **your own solvers** by subclassing our base solver class and focusing directly on the solver logic.
- Simulate SME trajectories **orders of magnitude faster** by batching the simulation over the stochastic trajectories.
- **Parallelise** large simulations across multiple CPUs/GPUs.

**Gradients**

- Choose between **various methods** to compute the gradient, to tradeoff speed and memory (e.g. use the optimal online checkpointing scheme of [Diffrax](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax) to compute gradients for large systems).
- Compute gradients with **machine-precision accuracy**.
- Evaluate **derivatives with respect to evolution time** (e.g. for time-optimal quantum control).
- Compute **higher order derivatives** (e.g. the Hessian).

**Utilities**

- Balance **accuracy and speed** by choosing between single precision (`float32` and `complex64`) or double precision (`float64` and `complex128`).
- Discover a custom **sparse data format** designed for matrices with only a few dense diagonals, offering substantial speedups for large systems.
- Plot beautiful figures by using our **handcrafted plotting function**.
- Apply any functions to **batched arrays** (e.g. `dq.wigner(states)` to compute the wigners of many states at once).
- Use **QuTiP objects as arguments** to any functions (e.g. if you have existing code to define your Hamiltonian in QuTiP, or if you want to use our nice plotting functions on a list of QuTiP states).

**Library development**

- Enjoy **modern software development practices and tools**.
- Build confidence from the **analytical tests** that verify state correctness and gradient accuracy for every solver, at each commit.

**Coming soon**

- Simulate using propagators solvers based on **Krylov subspace methods**.
- **Benchmark code** to compare solvers and performance for different systems.

## The Dynamiqs project

**Philosophy**

There is a noticeable gap in the availability of an open-source library that simplifies gradient-based parameter estimation and quantum optimal control. In addition, faster simulations of large systems are essential to accelerate the development of quantum technologies. The **Dynamiqs** library addresses both of these needs. It aims to be a fast and reliable building block for **GPU-accelerated** and **differentiable** solvers. We also work to make the library compatible with the existing Python ecosystem (i.e. JAX and QuTiP) to allow easy interfacing with other libraries.

**Team and sponsoring**

The library is being developed by a **team of physicists and developers**. We are working with theorists, experimentalists, machine learning practitioners, optimisation and numerical methods experts to make the library as useful and as powerful as possible. The library is sponsored by the startup [Alice & Bob](https://alice-bob.com/), where it is being used to simulate, calibrate and control chips made of superconducting-based dissipative cat qubits.

**History**

Development started in early 2023, the library was originally based on PyTorch with homemade solvers and gradient methods. It was completely rewritten in JAX in early 2024 for performance.
