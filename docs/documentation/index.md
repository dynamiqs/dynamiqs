# Documentation

Welcome to the Dynamiqs documentation! This page will guide you through learning Dynamiqs, from installation and basic examples to advanced tutorials. You can also find a list of available functions and classes in the [Python API](../python_api/index.md).

## Getting started

First time using Dynamiqs? Get to know the library and run your first simulations.

- [What is Dynamiqs?](getting_started/whatis.md)
- [Installation](getting_started/installation.md)
- [Basic examples](getting_started/examples.md)
- [The sharp bits 🔪](getting_started/sharp-bits.md)

## Learn the basics

Familiarize yourself with Dynamiqs. Learn how to simulate quantum systems, define time-dependent operators, run multiple simulations concurrently, and compute gradients.
