    r"""Solve the jump stochastic master equation (SME).

    Warning:
        This function has not been implemented yet. The following API is indicative
        of the planned implementation.

    The jump SME describes the evolution of a quantum system measured by
    a jump detector (for example photodetection in quantum optics). This function
    computes the evolution of the density matrix $\rho(t)$ at time $t$, starting from
    an initial state $\rho_0$, according to the jump SME ($\hbar=1$, time is
    implicit(1))

        \begin{split}
            \dd\rho =&~ -i[H, \rho]\,\dt + \sum_{k=1}^N \left(
                L_k \rho L_k^\dag
                - \frac{1}{2} L_k^\dag L_k \rho
                - \frac{1}{2} \rho L_k^\dag L_k

    where $H$ is the system's Hamiltonian, $\{L_k\}$ is a collection of jump operators,
    each continuously measured with dark count rate $\theta_k\geq0$ and efficiency
    $0\leq\eta_k\leq1$ ($\eta_k=0$ for purely dissipative loss channels) and $\dd N_k$
    are independent point processes with law

            \mathbb{P}[\dd N_k = 1] &= \left(\theta_k + \eta_k \tr{L_k\rho L_k^\dag}\right) \dt.

    1. With explicit time dependence:
        - $\rho\to\rho(t)$
        - $H\to H(t)$
        - $L_k\to L_k(t)$
        - $\dd N_k\to \dd N_k(t)$

    The continuous-time measurements are defined by the point processes $\dd N_k$. The
    solver returns the times at which the detector clicked,
    $I_k = \{t \in [t_0, t_\text{end}[ \,|\, \dd N_k(t)=1\}$.

    Warning:
        For now, `jsmesolve()` only supports linearly spaced `tsave` with values that
        are exact multiples of the method fixed step size `dt`.

    Args:
        H _(qarray-like or time-qarray of shape (...H, n, n))_: Hamiltonian.
        jump_ops _(list of qarray-like or time-qarray, each of shape (n, n))_: List of
            jump operators.
        thetas _(array-like of shape (len(jump_ops),))_: Dark count rate for each
            loss channel.
        etas _(array-like of shape (len(jump_ops),))_: Measurement efficiency for each
            loss channel with values between 0 (purely dissipative) and 1 (perfectly
            measured). No measurement is returned for purely dissipative loss channels.
        rho0 _(qarray-like of shape (...rho0, n, 1) or (...rho0, n, n))_: Initial state.
        tsave _(array-like of shape (ntsave,))_: Times at which the states and
            expectation values are saved. The equation is solved from `tsave[0]` to
            `tsave[-1]`.
        keys _(list of PRNG keys)_: PRNG keys used to sample the point processes.
            The number of elements defines the number of sampled stochastic
            trajectories.
        exp_ops _(list of array-like, each of shape (n, n), optional)_: List of
            operators for which the expectation value is computed.
        method: Method for the integration. No defaults for now, you have to specify a
            method (supported: [`EulerMaruyama`][dynamiqs.method.EulerMaruyama]).
        gradient: Algorithm used to compute the gradient. The default is
            method-dependent, refer to the documentation of the chosen method for more
            details.
        options: Generic options (supported: `save_states`, `cartesian_batching`,
            `save_extra`, `nmaxclick`).
            ??? "Detailed options API"
                ```
                dq.Options(
                    save_states: bool = True,
                    cartesian_batching: bool = True,
                    save_extra: callable[[Array], PyTree] | None = None,
                    nmaxclick: int = 10_000,
                )
                ```

                **Parameters**

                - **save_states** - If `True`, the state is saved at every time in
                    `tsave`, otherwise only the final state is returned.
                - **cartesian_batching** - If `True`, batched arguments are treated as
                    separated batch dimensions, otherwise the batching is performed over
                    a single shared batched dimension.
                - **save_extra** _(function, optional)_ - A function with signature
                    `f(QArray) -> PyTree` that takes a state as input and returns a
                    PyTree. This can be used to save additional arbitrary data
                    during the integration, accessible in `result.extra`.
                - **nmaxclick** - Maximum buffer size for `result.clicktimes`, should be
                    set higher than the expected maximum number of jump event.

    Returns:
        `dq.JSMESolveResult` object holding the result of the jump SME integration. Use
            `result.states` to access the saved states, `result.expects` to access the
            saved expectation values and `result.clicktimes` to access the detector
            click times.

            ??? "Detailed result API"
                ```python
                dq.JSMESolveResult
                ```

                For the shape indications we define `ntrajs` as the number of
                trajectories (`ntrajs = len(keys)`) and `nLm` as the number of measured
                loss channels (those for which the measurement efficiency is not zero).

                - **states** _(qarray of shape (..., ntrajs, nsave, n, n))_ - Saved
                    states with `nsave = ntsave`, or `nsave = 1` if
                    `options.save_states=False`.
                - **final_state** _(qarray of shape (..., ntrajs, n, n))_ - Saved final
                    state.

                    expectation values, if specified by `exp_ops`.
                - **clicktimes** _(array of shape (..., ntrajs, nLm, nmaxclick))_ - Times
                    at which the detectors clicked. Variable-length array padded with
                    `None` up to `nmaxclick`.
                - **extra** _(PyTree or None)_ - Extra data saved with `save_extra()` if
                    specified in `options`.

                    sample the Wiener processes.
                - **infos** _(PyTree or None)_ - Method-dependent information on the

    # Advanced use-cases

    ## Defining a time-dependent Hamiltonian or jump operator

    If the Hamiltonian or the jump operators depend on time, they can be converted
    to time-arrays using [`dq.pwc()`][dynamiqs.pwc],
    [`dq.modulated()`][dynamiqs.modulated], or
    [`dq.timecallable()`][dynamiqs.timecallable]. See the
    [Time-dependent operators](../../documentation/basics/time-dependent-operators.md)
    tutorial for more details.

    ## Running multiple simulations concurrently

    The Hamiltonian `H` and the initial density matrix `rho0` can be batched to
    solve multiple SMEs concurrently. All other arguments (including the PRNG key)
    are common to every batch. The resulting states, click times and expectation values
    are batched according to the leading dimensions of `H` and `rho0`. The behaviour
    depends on the value of the `cartesian_batching` option.

    === "If `cartesian_batching = True` (default value)"
        The results leading dimensions are
        ```
        ... = ...H, ...rho0
        ```
        For example if:

        - `H` has shape _(2, 3, n, n)_,
        - `rho0` has shape _(4, n, n)_,

        then `result.states` has shape _(2, 3, 4, ntrajs, ntsave, n, n)_.

    === "If `cartesian_batching = False`"
        The results leading dimensions are
        ```
        ... = ...H = ...rho0  # (once broadcasted)
        ```
        For example if:

        - `H` has shape _(2, 3, n, n)_,
        - `rho0` has shape _(3, n, n)_,

        then `result.states` has shape _(2, 3, ntrajs, ntsave, n, n)_.

    See the
    [Batching simulations](../../documentation/basics/batching-simulations.md)
    tutorial for more details.

    Warning:
        Batching on `jump_ops`, `thetas` and `etas` is not yet supported, if this is
        needed don't hesitate to
